Change the key and value in the conformer 
Try foa with onformer maybe?

Resnet 34 gru and da1+2
Resnet and conformer joint model
Resnet + Conformer ensemble
D3Net + Conformer ensemble
Conformer +  Transformer (not self-attetnion)
maybe use nas to find the 3 cnn models for ensemble

TFRNN block instead of gru (Shimada)
Use spatial augmentation method (Shimada) for increase in doa
Postprocessing like During the inference, we split the 60-second inputs into shorter segments that overlap. Subsequently, each segment is processed, and
the results of overlapped frames are averaged( Shimada)
Different folds in training

Adaptive grad clipping and test time augment
3 FC out layers (and maybe with parallel learning, see Lee)

NAS and separate branch learning
